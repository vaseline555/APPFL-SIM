# Algorithm Placeholders

This folder provides placeholder simulation configs for algorithms implemented in
`appfl_sim/algorithm/aggregator`.

Notes:
- These are intended as starter configs for users.
- Current simulator path uses APPFL-style `ServerAgent` and `ClientAgent`, with
  server aggregation wired through `appfl_sim/algorithm/aggregator`.
- Evaluation-focused examples are under `appfl_sim/config/algorithms/evaluation/`.
